-   Make sure that dependency uses a Field.pm method to test for not_blank
    so that can be defined per field.

-   Add localization tools to error messages.

-   Add warnings in addition to errors.  The example would be validating
    HTML where Tidy reports an error or warning that you wish to ignore.
    This would be an extra checkbox next to the warnings.
