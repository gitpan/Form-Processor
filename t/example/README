This is a Catalyst demo using Form::Processor.

    Requires:
        Catalyst::Runtime
        Template::Toolkit

    Not all fields are displayed because not all modules
    used by every field in Form::Processor is required.
    Just trying to avoid CPAN dependency hell.


To use

    $ cd FormProcessor
    $ script/formprocessor_server.pl

Watch carefully for any errors due to missing modules.  Install, re-heat,
and serve.

Then go to http://localhost:3000
